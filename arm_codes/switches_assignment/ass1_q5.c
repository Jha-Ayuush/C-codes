/*
         5. PART2: Implement up and down counter. Use two AL switches and 8 leds (4-active
                  high leds and 4-active low leds) as mentioned:
                  As long as sw1 is pressed increment the count value with respect to 1 sec
                  As long as sw2 is pressed decrement count value with respect to 1 sec
                  And display updated count on leds.
                  If both switches are pressed at a time, donâ€™t do any operation on count.
            Note: if count value is 0, at this time if sw2 pressed it should display 0 only on leds and if
                 count value is 255 then if sw1 pressed it should display 255 only on leds.
